A take is one recording of a verse or chunk. Each verse/chunk may have multiple recordings. There is not a separate page to show the takes. Instead, they are displayed in a bar under the verse or chunk, and you can navigate between them by using the left and right arrows. The components of the Take bar are:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>The timeline of the length of the audio take. The line expands left to right as the audio take plays. The time at the right shows the length of the recording; the time at the left increments as the recording plays.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>2.      Garbage can icon - Delete a selected take.
NOTE: The numbering of the takes changes to reflect the lower number of takes available.
3.      Waveform icon - Invoke the Edit screen to edit the take (see Edit screen).
4.      Play icon - Play the recording. Tap the Pause icon (replaces the Play icon) to stop playing the recording.
5.      Checkmark – Tap to turn green, or if green, tap to turn black. The green color means that the take is approved to use when compiling a chapter recording. When the take is rated 3 stars, this checkmark is green, or you can just tap it to turn it green. Only one take per verse or chunk can be marked with a green checkmark.
6.      Star icon - Rate the recording. Only one take per verse or chunk can be rated three stars, indicating the take that is approved to use when compiling a chapter recording.
7.      Left or right arrow - Navigate among takes for a verse. Notice that the take number changes.</p>

<div class="section" id="using-the-options-menu">
<h1>Using the Options Menu<a class="headerlink" href="#using-the-options-menu" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>The 3-dot menu (Options menu) appears only on the Project Management screen’s Project list and can be found at the far right on the top blue bar. Tap the 3 dots to invoke the Options menu.
On the options menu you can tap one of the following menu options:
•       Settings – View or change the settings of the program.
•       Logout – Sign out of the program. The program restarts at the User Account screen.
•       Help – View this documentation on how to use the BTT Recorder program. An internet connection is necessary to view the documentation.
The Settings window is mostly for information purposes. You can invoke the Settings window by tapping the Settings option in the Options menu. Although you can change some of the settings, it usually is not necessary. The Settings window contains the following information:
•       Source Audio Location – Sets the default folder that opens when you select a source audio location for a project. Although you can set the value here, the default location changes if you select a different location when defining a project.
       Tap to open
       Choose BTT Recorder and tap ALWAYS so that you never have to make the choice again. The window closes.
       A file manager window opens so that you can navigate to the location of the file to use as source audio. Tap the file.
       The window closes. The next time you define a project’s source audio, the file manager opens to this location.
•       Source Language – It is not necessary to set a source language, because even if it is set you still need to define it each time you create a project.
       Tap to open
       Search for the language from the list of languages.
       Tap the language name.
       The window closes.
•       Add Temporary Language – Adds a language to the target language list that displays in BTT Recorder. You may need to do this if your target language does not appear in the target language list.
       Tap to open
       Enter the language name
       Enter a code of exactly 6 characters
       Tap ADD to add the language and close the window.
•       Update Languages From translationDatabase – Updates the list of target languages that displays in BTT Recorder.
       Tap to run the update
       The update processes
       The pop-up message window closes when the update completes, and a success message briefly displays.
•       Update Languages From file – A file manager opens to enable you to locate the file to use.
•       Change Upload Server – Tap to change the server to which recording projects get uploaded.
•       BTT Recorder Version cannot be changed. It is displayed for information only.
Tap the back arrow at the top left of the Settings window to return to the Project Management screen.</p>
