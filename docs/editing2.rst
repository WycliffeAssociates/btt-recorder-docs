Remove a Section of the Recording 
***************************************

The action of removing a section of a recording is known as a 'cut.'

Mark a section for Deletion
=======================

You position the recording on the blue line. **The blue line does not move.** The blue line is very thin and is at the beginning of the waveform.

There are 2 places to mark a section for deletion - the upper or the lower waveform window.

**In the upper waveform window:**

1. Position the audio at the thin blue line for the beginning of the section to be removed. You will need to do move the recording so that the blue line is where the cut should begin.

*  Use the press-hold-drag action in the waveform window to move the recording so that the blue line is at the beginning of the section to cut. 
*  Or tap Pause while listening to the recording when you reach the beginning of the section to cut.

2. Tap the flag icon. This inserts a marker where the cut will start.
3. In the upper waveform window, drag the recording by holding your finger on the screen and sliding to the left until the end of the part to be removed is at the blue line. Or tap the Pause icon while listening to the recording when you reach the end of the section to cut.
4. Tap the upside-down flag to mark the end of the section for deletion. 

Go to Make the Deletion section.

**In the lower waveform window:**

1. Tap and hold where you want the deletion to begin and then drag to where the end of the deletion should be. As you do so, the marked area is shown in both the upper and lower waveform areas and the flags are inserted automatically.
2. Resize the section marked by dragging the large flags on the large waveform window. 

**HINT**: You may want to check the selection by tapping the **Play** icon to listen to the section that will be removed. Move the flags to select the desired recording to be deleted.
