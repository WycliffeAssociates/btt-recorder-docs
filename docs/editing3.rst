Rate the Recording
######################################

To indicate the quality of the recording, you can add a star rating to it. 

Rating is important because - The manually added star ratings are used by the program to determine which take of a verse or chunk to use when compiling an entire chapter recording. 

* If there is only one take – no rating is necessary.
* If there are multiple takes – the program uses the most recent recording for the chapter recording.

There are two places to mark a Star Rating, 1) in the **Verse Management** screen or 2) in the **Recording** screen. 

**Verse Management Screen**

1.	In the Verse Management screen, choose the desired take to open the Verse/Chunk Take bar.
2.	You may want to click the play icon to hear the take again, then click the Star icon on the right side of the bar. The Star Rating window opens.

**Recording Screen**

 1.	In the recording screen, click the Star icon on the right side of the top menu bar. The Star Rating window opens.

**In the Star Rating window.**

In the Star Rating window, you will tap on a star to select the rating. 

* The left star if the recording is not the best – the star turns red.
* The middle star if the recording is fine but could be better – the two leftmost stars turn yellow.
* The right star for the recording that you want to use – the stars all turn green.

**NOTE**: Only one take for a verse or chunk can be rated three stars.

Tap OK to save.
