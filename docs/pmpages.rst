Project Summary
=====

The projects shown on the screen are organized by the most recently viewed. Each project is on a separate bar.

**NOTE**: The most recently viewed project – the one that was worked on last – is separate from all projects. 

The **column headings** show the order of information on the project bars:

* Language – This is the Target Language of the project.

* Book – This is the book that is being translated or recorded. 

* Completeness – The circle fills with blue as the project progresses.

There are two icons on each of the project bars:

* Information icon  –  See further information below.

* Microphone icon  – Tap to open the recording screen.

The 3-dot (Options) Menu

The 3-dot menu (Options menu) appears only on the Project Management screen and can be found at the far right on the top blue bar.

Settings Menu
-----
 
The Settings menu enables you to view and/or change the following settings:

**Source Audio Location** – This is the default folder that opens when you select a source audio location for a project. 

NOTE: Although you can set the value here, it is recommended to not make any changes here unless directed otherwise by a technical support person.
The default location changes if you select a different location when defining a project. So, the default value changes to the most recent location specified when defining a project.

The steps for the technical support person are a file manager window opens so that they can navigate to the location of the file to use as source audio. Tap the file. The window closes. The next time you define a project’s source audio, the file manager opens to this location.

**Source Language** – It is not necessary to set a source language, because even if it is set you still need to define it each time you create a project. 

* Tap to open.

* Search for the language from the list of languages.

* Tap the language name.

* The window closes.

**Add Temporary Language** – Adds a language to the target language list that displays in BTT Recorder. You may need to do this if your target language does not appear in the target language list.

*	Tap to open

*	Enter the language name

* Enter a code of exactly 6 characters

* Tap ADD to add the language and close the window.


**Update Languages From translationDatabase** – updates the list of target languages that displays in BTT Recorder.

* Tap to run the update

* The update processes

* The pop-up message window closes when the update is complete and a success message briefly displays.

**Update Languages From File** – Most likely this is a process that is done by a technical support person. 

**Change Upload Server** – Tap to change the server to which recording projects get uploaded. The default is opentranlationtools.org. Currently this process is not available in BTT Recorder.

**The BTT Recorder Version** cannot be changed. It is displayed for information only.

Tap the back arrow at the top left to return to the Project Management screen.
