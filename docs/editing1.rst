    **NOTE:** The numbering of the takes changes to reflect the lower number of takes available.

 * Tap on the middle star if the recording is fine but could be better – the stars turn yellow.
 * Tap on the right star for a very good recording – the starts turn green. Only one take per verse/chunk can be rated 3 stars, because this indicates the accepted take.
