The items in the verse take bar are (listed top to bottom and left to right):

1. The time line of the length of the audio take. The line expands left to right as the audio take plays.

2. Garbage can icon - Delete a selected take. 

    **NOTE:** The numbering of the takes changes to reflect the lower number of takes available. 

3. Waveform icon - Invoke the editing screen of BTT Recorder.
4. Play icon - Play the recording. Tap the Pause icon (replaces the Play icon) to stop the recording.
5. Checkmark – Tap to turn green, or if green, tap to turn black. The green color means that the take is approved to use. When the take is rated 3 stars, this checkmark is green, or you can just tap it to turn it green. Only one take per verse or chunk can be marked with a green checkmark.
6. Star icon - Rate the recording.
7. Left or right arrow - Navigate among takes for a verse. Notice that the take number changes.

Rate the recording:
*****

To indicate the quality of the recording, you can add a star rating to it. The star ratings are used for the program to determine which take of a verse or chunk to use when compiling an entire chapter recording.

1. Tap the Star icon on the verse bar.
 * Tap the left star if the recording is not the best – the star turns red.
 * Tap the middle star if the recording is fine but could be better – the stars turn yellow.
 * Tap the right star for a very good recording – the starts turn green. Only one take per verse/chunk can be rated 3 stars, because this indicates the accepted take.
2. Tap OK to save.
