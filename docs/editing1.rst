Edit Recordings in Project Management
#############################################

See the `"Edit Screen Icons" <https://github.com/WycliffeAssociates/btt-recorder-docs/raw/master/appendix/BTT-Recorder_Edit_Screen_Icons_v1.4.pdf>`_ document for the list of icons and their name. 

There are several steps to follow to edit an existing recording:

* Find the recording.
* Edit the recording – you can remove a section of the recording or add a new section.
* Rate the recording. (Optional)
* Place the verse markers.

Find a Recording
****************** 
1. Start at the Project Management screen. Tap on a Project bar to edit.
2. Tap on the Chapter bar.
3. Tap the arrow at the end of the verse bar. 

The take management bar opens. (**A 'take' is the word that refers to a recording.**) It is now possible to work with the recordings from this verse. 

Tap the right or left arrow to go between the audio takes for a verse. Notice that the take number changes.

The items in the verse take bar are (listed top to bottom and left to right):

1. The time line of the length of the audio take. The dot moves left to right as the audio take plays.
2. Garbage can icon - Delete a selected take. Notice that the numbering of the takes changes to reflect the lower number of takes now available. 
3. Waveform icon - Opens the editing screen of BTT Recorder.
4. Play icon - Play the recording. Tap the Pause icon (replaces the Play icon) to stop the recording.
5. Checkmark – Tap to turn green, or if green, tap to turn black. The green color means that the take is approved to use. When the take is rated 3 stars, this checkmark is green, or you can just tap it to turn it green. Only one take per verse or chunk can be marked with a green checkmark.
6. Star icon - Tap the star icon to rate the recording.
7. Left or right arrow - Navigate through the takes for a different take. Notice that the take number changes.
