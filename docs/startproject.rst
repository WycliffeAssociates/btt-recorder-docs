Starting a New Project
==========================

Start a New Project From the Recording Section (Blue)
-----

**NOTE**: You can start a new project in the Recording Section ONLY when it is the first time BTT Recorder is used (a new install.)

1.	From the home screen (half green and half blue), tap in the blue area to start recording.

**NOTE**: During these next steps, you may tap on the left arrow in the top blue bar to go back to the previous screen at any time. You may want to go to the previous screen to make a different choice.

2.	Select the Target Language.  (The Target Language is the language into which you will translate.)

   * You can search for your desired language in one of two ways:
   
     * By swiping from the bottom of the screen up to scroll through the languages
     
     * By tapping the magnifying glass
     
       *	The Keyboard appears. Type in the language or language code. 
       
       * Close the keyboard by using the down arrow icon, or back arrow icon.

   * Tap on the name of the desired Target Language. The program goes to the Choose a Project step.
 
3. Choose a Project - Choose, by tapping once, from the choices of Bible:Old Testament or Bible:New Testament or Bible stories:Open Bible Stories.

4. Choose a Book - Tap on a book in the Bible. Swipe up to see more book names, or use the magnifying glass to search for the book.

5. Choose a Translation Type - Tap to choose. 

  * If you are using source audio, you must select the same Translation Type as the source audio.
  
  * If you are translating from the UDB or ULB, tap one of those choices. Otherwise, tap REG: Regular. 
   **Note**: This choice does not apply to Open Bible Stories.

6. Choose a Mode - Tap to choose either Verse or Chunk mode. This is how the translation will be divided. 

  * The ‘Verse’ mode has each recording separated like a regular Bible, one verse at a time.
  * The ‘Chunk’ mode has each recording separated according to groups of verses.

  **NOTE: You must select the same Translation Type and Mode as the source audio if you are using source audio.**

The program goes to the Source Audio step.
