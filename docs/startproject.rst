Create a New Project
########################

You can start creating a new project by one of the following methods:

* Only on a new install, by tapping the right area (recording section) on the home screen. 
* From the Project Management screen, by tapping the New Project button (seen only on a new install) or the Plus icon. 

Once you have initiated the project, the steps to define it are the same:

1.	Select a target language. 
2.	Select the project type. 
3.	Select the recording mode.
4.	Select a source audio (optional.) 

**NOTE**: You can start a new project in the Recording Section ONLY when it is the first time BTT Recorder is used (a new install.)


Select the Target Language
***********************************
(The Target Language is the language into which you will translate.)

You can search for your desired language in one of two ways:
   
* By swiping from the bottom of the screen up to scroll through the languages
     
* By tapping the **magnifying glass**. The Keyboard appears. Type in the language or language code. 

 * Close the keyboard by using the **down arrow** icon, or **back arrow** tablet icon.
 * You may need to scroll to see the entire list of languages.

* Tap on the name of the desired Target Language. The program goes to the Choose a Project step.
 
Select the Project Type
****************************
The Project type defines what you will be translating from and consists of:

1. What kind of project? 

2. Which book or story? And 

3. If you are translating the Bible, which translation type?


What kind of project? 
==============

Tap to select from the choices of:

*	Bible: Old Testament 

*	Bible: New Testament

*	Open Bible Stories. 

Which book or story?
===============
	
Tap a book in the Bible or a Bible story to translate. 

Swipe up to see more book or story names.

If you are translating the Bible, which translation type?
=======================================

**Note**: This choice does not apply to Open Bible Stories.

Most likely you will choose the **REG: Regular** type. This is the most chosen type.

If you are translating for the UDB: Unlocked Dynamic Bible or ULB: Unlocked Literal Bible, tap one of those choices.

Select the recording mode
**********************************
**Note**: This choice does not apply to Open Bible Stories.

This defines whether you will record a verse at a time or a chunk at a time. In most cases, you should record in verse mode. 

* Verse mode has each recording separated like a regular Bible, one verse at a time.

* Chunk mode has each recording separated according to groups of verses. 

If you are using source audio, the mode that you select should match that of the source audio. 

You may want to check with the language’s Translation Team Lead or Technical Support person to learn which should be chosen.

Select the Source Language
*********************************

1. Tap on the top green bar (SOURCE LANGUAGE:) to select the language of the Source Audio. (The Source Language audio is the language from which you will translate.)

2. You can search for the desired source language in one of two ways:
  
    * By swiping from the bottom of the screen up to scroll through the languages.
    
    * By tapping the magnifying glass.
     * The Keyboard appears. Type in the language or language code. 
     * Close the keyboard by using the down arrow icon, or back arrow icon.

3. Tap on the name of the desired Source Language. 

Select the Source Audio File
***********************************

In the Source Audio window:

4. Tap on the bottom green bar (SELECT SOURCE LOCATION:) to load the source audio. The file manager should open to the directory of where the audio files are located.

**NOTE**: The audio files are named in this way: *Language Code_Translation Type_Book Code*.tr  So, for the ULB audio of the book of Titus in Swahili the file would be named "sw_ulb_Titus.tr". 

**Hint**: You may need to search in the Internal Storage for ``*``.tr files. 

3. Tap on the name of the desired Source Language audio file. The program goes back to the Source Audio window.

4. Confirm that the information in the green bar is correct. 

5. Tap on the word ‘CONTINUE’ at the bottom right of the screen. 


Select a source audio
***************************

The recording window opens.

You are ready to work within BTT Recorder. At any time, you may tap the back arrow at the bottom left of the screen. That will take you out to the main menu.

Go to `Recording <https://btt-recorder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/recording.html>`_ for instructions on how to record.
