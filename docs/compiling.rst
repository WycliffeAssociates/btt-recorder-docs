Create Chapter Recording
========

After the verse or chunk recordings have been created for a chapter it is then possible to make a recording into a complete chapter. The translator can listen to the entire chapter and make additional edits if necessary.
 
**Terms to know**: 
 * Compile – to put into one piece, combine.
 * Stitch – to compile the different recordings into one recording.
 * Packaging - to prepare the recordings for compressing into a smaller file. This process is done automatically by the software.
 
Complete the Recording of the Chapter
-----
1. Start in the Project Management home screen and tap on the book to finish. Notice that the circle should be full. 
The chapters are listed – each one on a separate bar. 

**NOTE**:
 * The black stack of papers means that all verses/chunks have recordings.
 * The gray stack of papers means that there are missing recordings.

2. Tap on a bar to open a chapter. Notice full blue circle. 
3. Check to make sure there is only one recording for each chunk or verse.

**NOTE**: if there is no number next to the microphone, there is only 1 take per verse/chunk.

**NOTE**: When there are multiple takes per verse or chunk, there are rules for what take is included in the chapter recording. These are the rules followed when combing a chapter into a single audio file:

 * If there is a recording with a star rating, they are included according to the number of stars. 
 
   * 3 green stars = first choice; 2 yellow stars = second choice; 1 red star = third choice
   * If there is not a star rating given, then a green check mark is used.
 * If there are no star rating and the check is not green, then the most recent take is used.

4. Tap on the back arrow ← on the top blue bar to return to the chapter listing.
5. Tap on the stack of paper icon to stitch the chapter into one file. 
6. Tap on OK to accept the action of making the chapter into a single file.

Repeat steps 2 – 6 for every chapter.

**Does the recording need editing?**
 * Are there long pauses? Go to the verse or chunk recording and delete the silence from the recording.
 * Are there things that need to be corrected? Go to the verse or chunk recording and make a new recording or edit the recording.
 
When the corrections have been made. Tap on the black stack of paper icon to stitch the chapter again.

Chapters with gray colored stack of paper

**HINTS**: There is no arrow next to the microphone. The verse/chunk number is in gray.

3. Record the verse or chunk. Once the verse or chunk is done, then the chapter is ready to be combined into one audio file.
4. Tap the ← at the top to return to the chapter listing.
5. Tap the black stack of paper to stitch the chapter.
