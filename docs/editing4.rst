Verse Markers
############################

Verse markers are only available for when recordings are done in chunk mode.

1. Open the recording that has been edited and is ready to share with others.
2. Tap on the bookmark icon

The Verse Marker window opens. 

* Notice the yellow playback bar on the bottom of the window.
* The top gray bar has the number of markers left to put into place.
* A verse marker is at the beginning of the recording.

3. Tap the play icon to playback the recording.
4. Tap the pause icon to stop the playback when it is at a verse ending.
5. To add the verse marker: Tap the white flag on the yellow bar.

If there is another verse to mark: Continue to listen to the playback for the next ending of a verse.

Optional ways of finding the correct spot in the recording:

* Use the press-hold-drag action to move the playback forward or backward. Have the verse division on the blue line.
* Use the press-hold-drag action to move the flag forward or backward on the wave form.

6. When there are no more verse markers to place – Tap the back icon (Android back) found under the yellow bar.

The verse markers are shown on the recording screen.

Tap the SD Card icon to save and return to Project Management.

**HINT**: you might want to rate this recording before saving.

To indicate the quality of the recording, you can add a star rating to it. The star ratings are used for the program to determine which take of a verse or chunk to use when compiling an entire chapter recording.

1. Tap the Star icon on the verse bar or in the top gray bar of the edit window. The ‘Rate this take’ window opens.
 * Tap the left star if the recording is not the best – the star turns red.
 * Tap the middle star if the recording is fine but could be better – the stars turn yellow.
 * Tap the right star for an excellent recording – the starts turn green. Only one take per verse/chunk can be rated 3 stars, because this indicates the accepted take.
2. Tap OK to save.
