Introduction to BTT Recorder
------------------------------

BTT Recorder consists of several user interface screens to enable you to record and edit oral translations of the Bible or Open Bible stories. Recordings are organized into projects that consist of:

*	A target language â€“ the language you are translating into
*	The project type, such as a book of the Bible or an Open Bible story

A project can optionally use source audio, so that the translator can listen to the source and then record its translation in the target language.

Before you can start recording, there are some steps you need to take:

*	Install BTT Recorder
*	Open the program
*	Create a new user
*	Create a new project

The main screens in BTT Recorder are:

*	Home page
