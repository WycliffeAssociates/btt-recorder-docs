Menus and Icons
========

The 3-dot (Options) Menu
-----
The 3-dot menu (Options menu) is only on the Project Management home screen and can be found at the far right on the top blue bar.  Choose from one of the following menu items:

* Settings - Tap to view the settings of the program.
 * Source Audio Location - Sets the default folder that opens when you select a source audio location for a project. (Although you can set the value here, the default location changes if you select a different location when defining a project. So the default value changes to the most recent location specified when defining a project.)
 * Source Language - It is not necessary to set a source language, because even if it is set you still need to define it each time you create a project. 
 * Add Temporary Language - Adds a language to the target language list that displays in BTT Recorder. You may need to do this if your target language does not appear in the target language list. Enter the common name of the language and then 6 letters after the code prefix on the second line. Tap **ADD** to save the new temporary code.
 * Update Languages From translationDatabase - Updates the list of target languages that displays in BTT Recorder.
 * Update Languages From file - A file manager opens to enable you to locate the file to use.
 * Change Upload Server – Tap to change the server to which recording projects get uploaded.
 * The BTT Recorder Version cannot be changed. It is displayed for information only.

  Tap the back arrow at the top left to return to the Project Management screen.

* Logout - Tap **Logout** to sign out of the program. The program restarts at the User Account screen.
* Help - View this set of documentation on how to use the BTT Recorder program. Internet connection is necessary to view the documentation.
