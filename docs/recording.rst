Recording
###############

Remember that there is inforamtion the Screen section that describes the parts of the Recording Screen. You may want to refer to this information while learning how to make a recording.

There are two main purposes for making a recording: 

* Audio recording - when a recording is created by reading a written translation of the Bible. 

* Oral translation - when a new translation of the Bible is created in an oral Heart Language.

Audio Recordings
===========
Audio recordings are when a recording is created by reading a written translation of the Bible. 

There are reasons to choose to do an audio recording:

1.	A translator translates from a written text that they can read into their Heart Language that is not a written language.
2.	A language group would like to have an audio recording of their written Bible to be used by those that cannot read the language.
3.	Create a Source Audio recording for another language to use in their translation work. Source Audio recordings are done by someone that can read and record a source text. 

Although it is tempting to read an entire chapter at once, BTT Recorder requires that you read a verse or chunk at a time so that you can have proper verse markers. Because of this, you must follow the same process as that for recording oral translations as explained below except that you do not need to include the source audio steps.


Oral Translations
================

Oral Translation recordings are when a new translation of the Bible is created in an oral (unwritten) Heart Language.

**NOTE** These instructions will describe how to create an oral translation using Source Audio. 

Please disregard references to Source Audio in the instructions, if the Source Audio has not been included in the Project setup.

After you have defined one or more projects, you can start recording. 

Steps to Follow from the Home Screen 
*******************************************

**Note**: This procedure enables you to record only the project that is named in the blue recording area. If a different project is shown, or no project is shown, you need to record from the Project Management screen as explained `below <https://btt-recorder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/recording.html#steps-to-follow-from-project-management>`_.

1.	On the home screen, tap in the blue recording area. 

2. If the Security warning shows, tap in the box before the words ‘Do not remind again.’ so that there is a checkmark in the box. Then tap the word ‘ALLOW.’ (This is the only time you will need to check and allow.)

3.	Check the information on the top gray bar:

  •	Target Language
  •	Project Type
  •	Book
  •	Chapter
  •	Verse or Chunk

3.	Use the + and – signs to correct the chapter or verse/chunk number.

4.	Tap the Microphone icon. (See more `detailed instructions <https://btt-recorder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/recording.html#detailed-instructions-for-the-recording-window>`_ for recording below.)

5.	Record the verse or chunk.

6.	Tap the Pause icon (2 vertical lines) when done saying the verse/chunk (the Pause icon replaces the Play icon).

7.	Tap the Checkmark icon in the bottom blue bar.

8.	Edit and rate the recording. See `Rate the Target Language Recording <https://btt-recorder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/editing3.html#rate-the-target-language-recording>`_. 

9.	Save the recording. The recording window closes and the home screen shows.

10.	Repeat steps 1 to 9 for all verses in the book. Be sure to change the chapter and/or verse number (step 3) each time.


Steps to Follow from the Project Management Screen
-----

1.	On the home screen, tap in the green Project Management side.

2.	Tap on the project bar that displays the language and book.

3.	Tap on the chapter bar that needs to be recorded.

4.	On the verse bar that needs to be recorded, tap on the Microphone icon.
   
   **HINT**: This is an easy way to keep track of which verses/chunks have recordings already so that you don’t unnecessarily record the same item over and over. It is also an easy way to navigate to the specific item you want to record. 

5.	Check the information on the top gray bar:

  •	Target Language
  •	Project Type
  •	Book
  •	Chapter
  •	Verse or Chunk

6.	Use the + and – signs to correct the chapter or verse/chunk number.

7.	Tap the Microphone icon. (See more `detailed instructions <https://btt-recorder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/recording.html#detailed-instructions-for-the-recording-window>`_ for recording below.)

8.	Record the verse or chunk.

9.	Tap the Pause icon when done saying the verse/chunk.

10.	Tap the Checkmark icon in the bottom blue bar.

11.	Edit and rate the recording. See `Rate the Target Language Recording <https://btt-recorder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/editing3.html#rate-the-target-language-recording>`_.

12.	Save the recording. The recording window closes and the Project Management window for the verses in that chapter appears.

13.	On the next verse bar that needs to be recorded, tap on the Microphone icon.

14.	Repeat steps 5 to 13 for all verses in the book. 



Detailed instructions for the Recording Window
----

In the Recording window you can see the Target Language, the Source, the Book, the Chapter and the Verse in the gray bar at the top of the screen. 

1.	If source audio is available, tap the Play button in the gray bar at the bottom of the screen to listen to the source language for that particular verse/chunk. The green dot will move along the line. The numbers on the left of the line count down and the numbers on the right count up the length of the audio recording. 

2.	Listen to the verse or chunk. 

  * The green dot will move along the line. 
  
  * The numbers on the left of the line count up as the recording plays. 
  
  * The numbers on the right display the length of the audio recording.

3.	Tap the Microphone icon in the blue bar to start recording.

4.	Speak clearly and loudly.

  * It is recommended that you use a separate microphone or a headset with a microphone, not just the microphone that is built into the tablet. 
  
  * As you begin to speak you will see a wavy line appear on the screen which is a result of the sound of your voice. 
 
5.	When done with that verse or chunk, tap the Pause button.

  * You can also tap Pause to temporarily Pause recording.
  
  * You can then start recording again by tapping on the Microphone icon
  
6 When you are finished, tap the Checkmark to go to the Edit window.
