Recording
==============

Steps to Follow from the Home Screen 
----

**Note**: This procedure enables you to record only the project that is named in the blue recording area. If a different project is shown, or no project is shown, you need to record from the Project Management screen as explained `below <https://btt-recorder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/recording.html#steps-to-follow-from-project-management>`_.

1.	On the home screen, tap in the blue recording area. 

2. If the Security warning shows, tap in the box before the words ‘Do not remind again.’ so that there is a checkmark in the box. Then tap the word ‘ALLOW.’ (This is the only time you will need to check and allow.)

3.	Check the information on the top gray bar:

  •	Target Language
  •	Project Type
  •	Book
  •	Chapter
  •	Verse or Chunk

3.	Use the + and – signs to correct the chapter or verse/chunk number.

4.	Tap the Microphone icon. (See more `detailed instructions <https://btt-recorder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/recording.html#detailed-instructions-for-the-recording-window>`_ for recording below.)

5.	Record the verse or chunk.

6.	Tap the Pause icon (2 vertical lines) when done saying the verse/chunk (the Pause icon replaces the Play icon).

7.	Tap the Checkmark icon in the bottom blue bar.

8.	Edit and rate the recording. See `Rate the Target Language Recording <https://btt-recorder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/editing3.html#rate-the-target-language-recording>`_. 

9.	Save the recording. The recording window closes and the home screen shows.

10.	Repeat steps 1 to 9 for all verses in the book. Be sure to change the chapter and/or verse number (step 3) each time.
